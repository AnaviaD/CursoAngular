During my time at ESIME, I not only expanded my knowledge in computer science but also gained a solid foundation in electronics and mechanics. As part of my extracurricular activities, I participated in the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) club, where I had the opportunity to work with welding tools and other specialized equipment, allowing me to develop unconventional automobiles as part of personal projects. Additionally, during my social service at the university, I contributed to improving the management of schedules and classrooms by implementing a system based on QR codes, making the process of reassigning spaces more efficient.",

The main goal was to eliminate paper usage in classrooms, providing students and teachers with immediate and up-to-date access to class schedules through a simple QR code scan. Each code was linked to a specific URL that redirected to a corresponding virtual classroom, allowing real-time schedule viewing. This system presented several advantages, such as the flexibility to make last-minute updates or changes to the schedules without needing to print new versions. Additionally, the implementation of QR codes led to greater efficiency in classroom management, ensuring that all users had access to the most recent information without paper waste or manual revisions. The digitalization of schedules not only facilitated communication between students and administration but also contributed to a more eco-friendly and modern solution for resource management in the school.",

The idea behind the project was to create a personalized user profile by recording the pulse and comparing it to previous values to ensure the vehicle couldn't be started by third parties, providing greater control and protection against potential theft. The system included the design, coding, and connection of key motorcycle components, such as the relay and electric starter motors. The goal was for only the registered user to activate the vehicle. However, during development, there were difficulties with the heart rate sensor, as the results varied greatly depending on the environment and the user's conditions, making the system unreliable for real-life use. This issue concluded that, although the prototype achieved its basic functionality, the practical application of heart rate as a security method was not feasible due to its inaccuracy and lack of stability in various situations.",
